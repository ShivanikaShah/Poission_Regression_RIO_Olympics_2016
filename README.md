# Poission_Regression_RIO_Olympics_2016
Predicting medals won by each country in 2016 Olympics 

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of the count regression techniques such as 
Poisson Regression and Negative Binomial Regression for the prediction of the total 
medals won by each country participating in the 2016 Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro. 
Since the response is unbounded count (0,1,2,3â€¦), we assume that a count regression 
model would be well suited for prediction of the total medals won by each country and to 
explain this in terms of the covariates used. Since the counts are not expected to be 
sufficiently large that a normal approximation is justified and hence using a normal linear 
model would not be appropriate.
